### Legacy Wine guide

VRCX on Linux was made possible by these people:

@RinLovesYou, @galister, @BenjaminZehowlt, @regalialong

Run `curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vrcx-team/VRCX/master/Linux/install-vrcx.sh | bash`

It'll preconfigure you a Wine bottle with VRCX.

You will require Wine >= 9.0 due to CEF and winetricks for corefonts.

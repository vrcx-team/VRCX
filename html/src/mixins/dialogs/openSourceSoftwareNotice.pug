                    SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
                    Copyright (c) 2020 June 20, Impallari Type, Andres Torresi, Jacques Le Bailly 
                    (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Encode+Sans),
                    with Reserved Font Name: Encode Sans.

                    PREAMBLE:
                    The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide development
                    of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation efforts of academic
                    and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and open framework in which
                    fonts may be shared and improved in partnership with others.

                    The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and redistributed
                    freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The fonts, including any
                    derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, redistributed and/or sold with any
                    software provided that any reserved names are not used by derivative works.
                    The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under any other type of
                    license. The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
                    to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

                    PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
                    Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of
                    the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify, redistribute, and
                    sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font Software, subject to the
                    following conditions:

                    1. Neither the Font Software nor any of its individual components, in Original or
                    Modified Versions, may be sold by itself.

                    2. Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled, redistributed
                    and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy contains the above copyright
                    notice and this license. These can be included either as stand-alone text files,
                    human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within
                    text or binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

                    3. No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font Name(s) unless
                    explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding Copyright Holder. This
                    restriction only applies to the primary font name as presented to the users.

                    4. The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font Software shall
                    not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any Modified Version, except to
                    acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and the Author(s) or with
                    their explicit written permission.

                    5. The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must be distributed
                    entirely under this license, and must not be distributed under any other license.
                    The requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to any document
                    created using the Font Software.

                    TERMINATION
                    This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are not met.

                    DISCLAIMER
                    THE FONT SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED âAS ISâ, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
                    IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
                    FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, PATENT, TRADEMARK, OR
                    OTHER RIGHT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM,
                    DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
                    OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE,
                    ARISING FROM, OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE FONT SOFTWARE OR FROM OTHER
                    DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
